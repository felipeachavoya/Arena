# Arena

Arena is turn based combat game. It is a clone
of games like Final Fantasy or Earthbound.
The goal of this "game" is primarily learn
game design concepts like AI, as well as to
learn the C++ programming language. At the time
of writing this readme, there really isn't an end
point for this project. But the hope is that I'll
at least have some game logic here from which I can
introduce some graphics to make a proper 2d turn
base game.
